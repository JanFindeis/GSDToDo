## Project

**Todo CLI**

A Node.js command-line tool for managing to-do items locally. Users run `todo add`, `todo list`, and `todo done` to create, view, and complete tasks. Items are persisted to a `todos.json` file in the current directory. No external npm dependencies — Node built-ins only.

**Core Value:** Three commands that just work: add a task, list tasks, mark one done — all backed by a local JSON file.

### Constraints

- **Tech stack**: Node.js built-ins only — no npm dependencies
- **Storage**: `todos.json` in the current working directory (not global)
- **Interface**: CLI only — no web UI, no daemon

## GSD Workflow Enforcement

Before using Edit, Write, or other file-changing tools, start work through a GSD command so planning artifacts and execution context stay in sync.

Use these entry points:

- `/gsd-quick` for small fixes, doc updates, and ad-hoc tasks
- `/gsd-debug` for investigation and bug fixing
- `/gsd-execute-phase` for planned phase work

Do not make direct repo edits outside a GSD workflow unless the user explicitly asks to bypass it.

## Developer Profile

> Profile not yet configured. Run `/gsd-profile-user` to generate your developer profile.
> This section is managed by `generate-claude-profile` -- do not edit manually.
